This repository contains code and artifacts developed during projects in the pulp and paper industry, focused on data analysis, process monitoring, and machine learning. The contents are organized as follows:

ðŸ“Š 1. Pulp Morphology â€“ Correlation & Data Visualization

Type: Jupyter Notebook

Description: Exploratory analysis of pulp morphology variables, including correlation matrices and custom data visualizations to support process insights.

ðŸ“‹ 2. Daily Quality Report (DQR) â€“ Paper Production

Type: Jupyter Notebook + Python Script (.py)

Automation: Executed via .bat file + Windows Task Scheduler

Description: Automated generation of a daily report on key paper quality metrics, including loading, preprocessing, and export to formatted Excel or PDF reports.

ðŸ“ˆ 3. Paper Stiffness Prediction Model

Type:
- Jupyter Notebooks (for model development and evaluation)
- Trained model file (.pkl)
- Python script (.py) for deployment

Automation: Executed via .bat file + Windows Task Scheduler

Description: Machine Learning model to predict paper stiffness from production parameters. Includes performance validation, model serialization, and automated inference.

ðŸ’¼ Context
These tools were developed in real industrial environments to support data-driven decision-making, quality control, and predictive modeling for pulp and paper manufacturing.
